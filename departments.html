                        The successful launch of a rocket relies on various factors, with aerodynamics, motor performance, and structural stability being some of the most crucial ones. The aerodynamics of a rocket deals with the study of airflow around it during the flight. The motor and nozzle play a vital role in rocket propulsion by providing the necessary thrust for the rocket to take off and reach its intended destination. At the same time, the strength and stability of the rocket's structure ensure that it can withstand the high pressure and temperature changes experienced during the flight. Together, these factors contribute to the safe and efficient operation of a rocket.

                        Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) systems are critical components of a rocket, responsible for ensuring its accurate flight and trajectory. These systems use a variety of sensors to collect data such as acceleration, gyroscopic values, altitude, pressure, humidity, and temperature, among others. The data is processed in real-time to make critical decisions on the course of the rocket's flight and its position in space. The GNC system also handles tasks like maneuvering the rocket to its intended destination and ensuring its stability during flight. With advancements in technology, GNC systems have become increasingly sophisticated, making space exploration safer and more reliable than ever before.

                        A rocket is launched for various reasons, ranging from scientific research to space exploration. It's a complex process that involves various stages and components. One such component is the CanSAT, which is a small satellite designed to carry out specific experiments and collect data. The CanSAT is usually mounted on the rocket and deployed into space. Recovery is a crucial aspect of the launch process. Once the fuel runs out, the rocket and the CanSAT must be recovered safely. This involves a safe landing and retrieving the components without causing damage. The recovery process is critical to ensure that the data collected by the CanSAT is not lost and the rocket can be reused for future launches.
